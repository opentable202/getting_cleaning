This repo is the submission to the Gettng and Cleaning Data project in Week 4 of the course.

It does the following:
<ul>
<li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.</li>
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.</li>
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.</li>
<li>From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
</ul>
